# Introduction
In programming, variables are used to store data that may be accessed and changed in a computer program. In this framework, `Variable` objects serve as a placeholder to inform the framework to grab the corresponding variable from the context object provided. For example, 
```matlab
Variable("Var1", 'bounded', 'double', min(data{:, 'Var1'}), max(data{:, 'Var1'}))
```
Given a program with the following pseudocode
```
IF Var1 > 50
    ...
ELSE
    ...
ENDIF
```
and the current context object contains
```matlab
env.Var1 = 25
```
When reaching the first line, the program needs the current value of `Var1` in order to determine whether `Var1` is greater than 50. Then, the framework will inform the program to grab the value from the context object `env`.

# Constructor
The constructor for environment variables
### Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `fieldName` | The name of the field. The identifier that is used to locate the environment variable from the context structure. |
| `valuesType` | The type of the environment variable. Can be either `none`, `enumerated`, or `bounded`. |
| `returnType` | The return type. Could be any type that the environment variable returns. |
| `arg1` | A shared variable. When valuesType is set to `enumerated`, the field should contain the list of allowed values. When the field valuesType is set to `bounded`, the lower bound of the variable's range should be provided. |
| `arg2` | Only need to be specified when the field valuesType is set to `bounded`. In such case, provide the upper bound of the variable's range. |
| `requiredTags` | A cell of tags required for object to present in the tree. See more on tag system. |

### `valuesType`
The type of the environment variable. Can be either `none`, `enumerated`, or `bounded`. The following table explains the difference between the three.
| Type | Description |
| - | - |
| `none` | When growing the parse tree, there won't be a `Value` object created to the right-hand side of the `Variable` object. |
| `enumerated` | Enumerated list of variables may be created to the right-hand side of the `Variable` object. |
| `bounded` | Values between specified ranges may be created to the right-hand side of the `Variable` object. |

### Examples

#### `none`
```matlab
Variable("MACDSignal", 'none', 'double');
```

#### `enumerated`
```matlab
Variable("Signal", 'enumerated', 'string', {"Buy", "Hold", "Sell"});
```

### `bounded`
```matlab
Variable("RSI", 'bounded', 'double', 0, 100);
```
You may also retrieve the range from your dataset.
```matlab
Variable("MACD", 'bounded', 'double', min(data{:, 'MACD'}), max(data{:, 'MACD'}));
```
Note: It is recommended that the `data` only contain the training set.
