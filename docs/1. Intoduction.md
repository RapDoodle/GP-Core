# Introduction
This chapter introduces you to the classes and concepts of the toolbox.

# Classes
The following table contains the classes that you need to concern when you build GA/GP models using the framework.

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| GAMember | An individual in the model. If you do not need to use GP, it should be implemented to specify the individual's behavior (crossover, mutation, and provide your chromosome representation). |
| GPMember | An individual in the GAModel/GPModel. Extends the GAMember class. No need to be extended as it contains all the genetic operators. |
| GAModel/GPModel | The GA/GP model contains GAMembers/GPMembers. It should be extended to specify the model's behavior. E.g., the fitness metric. |
| Template | A template object. It determines what the parse tree (GP) will look like. |
| Node | (Optional) The superclass for all nodes in the parse tree. You only need to extend the class when you implement custom nodes. |
