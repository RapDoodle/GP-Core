# Introduction
A `Template` contains the specification of how a parse tree is allowed to grow. By using the template system, we can ensure that the parse tree grows as desired, and we don't need to spend computing resources on fixing incorrect genetic programs.

# Quickstart
The following code is part of the . In the example, 

# Constructor
The constructor of a `Template` object takes in no argument. Or, it can take in a `containers.Map()`, which contains the key-value-pair specification of the template, as input.

# Methods
The class contains the following methods:
| Signature | Description |
| - | - |
| `set(tpl, key, val)` | Initialize the individual. |
| `extend(tpl, key, val)` | Execute the strategy. |
Note: The table omits methods used internally in the system.

## `set(tpl, key, val)`
Replace part of the current individual's parse tree with the `mateMember`'s. 
### Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `template` | The template specifies how the parse tree is grown. |
| `maxHeight` | The maximum height allowed for the parse tree. |
