# Introduction

`GAMember` is intended for those who wish not to use GP. Because a chromosome can be represented differently for different applications, this is only an abstract class that contains abstract methods to be implemented. If you wish to optimize a neural network using genetic algorithm, consider checking out my framework on neural networks [
LightNeuNet-MATLAB](https://github.com/RapDoodle/LightNeuNet-MATLAB).

# Properties
| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| `fitness` | The fitness score of the individual. The default behavior of the GAModels does NOT depend on this property. This property is only for convenient statistics retrieval. |

# Abstract Methods
| Signature | Description |
| - | - |
| `crossover(member, mateMember, opt)` | Crossover operation in GA. |
| `mutate(member, opt)` | Mutation in GA. |

## `crossover(member, mateMember, opt)`
Replace part of the current individual's chromosome with the `mateMember`'s. 
### Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `mateMember` | The other individual whose sections chromosome will be passed to the current `member` |
| `opt` | Options for developers to specify |

## `mutate(member, opt)`
Change part of the chromosome with randomly generated ones. The genetic operator introduces gene diversity into the population.
### Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `opt` | Options for developers to specify |
