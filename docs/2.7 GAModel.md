# Introduction
`GAModel` is an abstract class that implements the genetic algorithm. Developers only need to extend the class to implement `init`, and `evaluateFitness` methods.

# Properties
| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| `population` | A cell containing all the individuals living in the population. |
| `constructor` | The constructor for individuals in the population. |
| `verbose` | The level of information that will show in the terminal. |
| `options` | Options used for optimizing the model. |
| `status` | A struct containing the current status of the model. |
| `statistics` | A struct containing the model's statistics. |
| `best` |The individual with the highest fitness score. |

## `options`
A struct containing options about the model.
| Option | Description |
| - | - |
| `verbose` | The verbose level. |
| `populationSize` | The size of the population. |
| `generations` | The number of generations to run. |
| `selectionSchema` | The schema used for selecting individuals for reproduction. Popular methods include `roulette`, `tournament`, and `rank`. Learn more on the section for selection schema. |
| `tournamentSize` | The number of individuals that will be randomly chosen for each tournament. Only used in tournament selection. |
| `eliteSize` | The number of individuals that are guaranteed to survive to the next generation. |
| `crossoverFraction` | After excluding the elites, it specifies the fraction of individuals in the next generation created by performing crossover on two selected parents. | 
| `mutateAfterCrossover` | Mutate on newly generated individuals. | 

### Setting an option
To set an option, use the `register` method.
```matlab
% Register a single attribute
myModel.register('verbose', verbose);

% Register a struct, will not override existing parameters.
opt.populationSize = 25;
opt.maxHeight = 6;
opt.generations = 20;
myGPModel.register(opt);
```

### `crossoverFraction`
After excluding the elites, it specifies the fraction of individuals in the next generation created by performing crossover on two selected parents. For example, when the `populationSize` is 50, `eliteSize` is 8, then a `crossoverFraction=0.70` will result in the generation consisting of:
- 10 elites directly copied from the previous generation.
- (50 - 8) * 0.8 = 29.4 = 29 (rounded) individuals are generated via crossover.
- The remaining 50 - 8 - 29 = 13 individuals are generated by mutating individuals from the previous generation.

### `verbose`
These levels decide the amount of information you will get. Available verbose levels:
- 0: Mute
- 1: Only show results for each generation
- 2: Show information for each generation
- 3: Show results for individual
- 4: Show information for each individual (default)

## `constructor`
The constructor for individuals in the population. Must be of type `GAMember` or any class that extends the `GAMember` class.

# Constructor
## Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `constructor` | The constructor for individuals in the population. |
## `constructor`
The constructor for individuals in the population. Must be of type `GAMember` or any class that extends the `GAMember` class.

# Execution
When calling the `run` method, it invokes the following methods. First, `beforeRun` is called at the beginning. `forEachGeneration` is called for each generation. Within `forEachGeneration`, `evaluateFitness` is called get the fitness score for each individual. The `evaluateFitness` method must be specified by the programmers to fit the specific application. After reaching the maximum number of generations or a certain criteria are met, the loop ends and `afterRun` is invoked.
```matlab
function stat = run(model, varargin)
    model.beforeRun(varargin{:});
    ...
    for gen=1:gens
        model.forEachGeneration(gen, gens, varargin{:});
    end
    ...
    model.afterRun(varargin{:});
end
```

# Public Methods
| Signature | Description |
| - | - |
| `populate(model)` | Populate the GA model with individuals. Should specify `populationSize` using the `register` method first. |
| `stat = run(model, varargin)` | Start optimizing with genetic algorithm on the model. |
| `register(model, arg1, arg2)` | Register an option or a struct of options with the model. |
| `beforeRun(model, varargin)` | The method invoked at the beginning of the `run` method. Refer to the execution cycle. By default, the method does nothing. |
| `afterRun(model, varargin)` | The method invoked at the end of the `run` method. Refer to the execution cycle. By default, the method does nothing. |

## `populate(model)`
Generate the initial population. 

## `stat = run(model, varargin)`
Optimize the model according to the execution cycle.
### Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `varargin` | The list of arguments that will be provided to `beforeRun`, `forEachGeneration`, `evaluateFitness`, and `afterRun`. |

## `register(model, arg1, arg2)`
Register options one by one, or with the entire struct.
### Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `arg1` | Provide a struct of options or a key. |
| `arg2` | Only when arg1 specified the key, specify the value. |

## `beforeRun(model, varargin)`
The method invoked at the beginning of the `run` method. Refer to the execution cycle.
### Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `varargin` | A list of arguments that were provided to `run`. |
By default, the function does nothing.

## `afterRun(model, varargin)`
The method invoked at the end of the `run` method. Refer to the execution cycle.
### Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `varargin` | A list of arguments that were provided to `run`. |
By default, the function does nothing.

# Abstract Methods
You must implement the following methods.
| Signature | Description |
| - | - |
| `init(model, varargin)` | Initialize every individual in the population. |
| `fitnesses = evaluateFitness(model, varargin)` | Evaulate the fitness and returns a vector of fitness values. |

## `fitnesses = evaluateFitness(model, varargin)`
The method should return a vector of size n, with the i-th entry being the fitness score of the i-th individual.
### Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `vargin` | A cell of arguments corresponding to the arguments (in order) provided to the `run` method. |
### Example
Here is an example that you can fill in to meet your own needs.

When calling the `run` method:

```matlab
myGAModel.run(myData, myOptions);
```

In the method:
```matlab
function fitnesses = evaluateFitness(model, varargin)
    % Localize variables to avoid unnessary communication overhead.
    % Skip this step if you do not use parallel computing toolbox.
    n = model.options.populationSize;
    
    % Retrieve the vairables initially provided when calling the 
    % run method.
    myData = varargin{1};
    myOptions = varargin{2};
    
    % Spread out the variable to avoid communication overhead when
    % using parallel computing toolbox
    population = model.population;
    
    fitnesses = zeros(n, 1);
    
    % Get status information from the status struct
    gen = model.status.generation;
    
    % Execute using MATLAB's parallel computing toolbox. If you do
    % not have the license for it, replace `parfor` with `for`.
    parfor s=1:n
        r = backtest(population{s}, myData);
        
        fprintf("[Generation %d] Strategy %d return: %s\n", ...
            gen, s, string(r));
        
        fitnesses(s) = r;
    end
end
```
