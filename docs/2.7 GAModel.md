# Introduction
`GAModel` is an abstract class that implements the genetic algorithm. Developers only need to extend the class to implement `init`, `beforeRun`, `forEachGeneration`, and the `afterRun` method.

# Properties
| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| `population` | A cell containing the  |
| `constructor` | The constructor for individuals in the population. |
| `verbose` | The level of information that will show in the terminal. |
| `options` | Options used for optimizing the model. |
| `status` | A struct containing the current status of the model. |
| `statistics` | A struct containing the model's statistics. |
| `best` |The individual with the highest fitness score. |

## `verbose`
These levels decide the amount of information you will get. Available verbose levels:
- 0: Mute
- 1: Only show results for each generation
- 2: Show information for each generation
- 3: Show results for individual
- 4: Show information for each individual (default)

# Constructor
## Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `constructor` | The constructor for individuals in the population. |
## `constructor`
The constructor for individuals in the population. Must be of type `GAMember` or any class that extends the `GAMember` class.

# Execution
When calling the `run` method, it invokes the following methods. First, `beforeRun` is called at the beginning. `forEachGeneration` is called for each generation. After reaching the maximum number of generations or a certain criteria are met, the loop ends and `afterRun` is invoked.
```matlab
function stat = run(model, varargin)
    model.beforeRun(varargin{:});
    ...
    for gen=1:gens
        model.forEachGeneration(gen, gens, varargin{:});
    end
    ...
    model.afterRun(varargin{:});
end
```

# Public Methods
| Signature | Description |
| - | - |
| `populate(model, populationSize)` | Populate the GA model with individuals. |
| `stat = run(model, varargin)` | Start optimizing with genetic algorithm on the model. |
| `beforeRun(model, varargin)` | The method invoked at the beginning of the `run` method. Refer to the execution cycle. By default, the method does nothing. |
| `afterRun(model, varargin)` | The method invoked at the end of the `run` method. Refer to the execution cycle. By default, the method does nothing. |

## `populate(model, populationSize)`
Generate the initial population. 
### Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `populationSize` | The size of the population. |

## `stat = run(model, varargin)`
Optimize the model according to the execution cycle.
### Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `varargin` | The list of arguments that will be provided to `beforeRun`, `forEachGeneration`, and `afterRun`. |
| `env` | Environment variables. |

## `beforeRun(model, varargin)`
The method invoked at the beginning of the `run` method. Refer to the execution cycle.
### Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `varargin` | A list of arguments that were provided to `run`. |
By default, the function does nothing.

## `afterRun(model, varargin)`
The method invoked at the end of the `run` method. Refer to the execution cycle.
### Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `varargin` | A list of arguments that were provided to `run`. |
By default, the function does nothing.

# Abstract Methods
You must implement the following methods.
| Signature | Description |
| - | - |
| `init(model, varargin)` | Initialize every individual in the population. |
| `beforeRun(model, varargin)` | The method invoked at the beginning of the `run` method. Refer to the execution cycle. |
| `forEachGeneration(model, gen, gens, varargin)` | The method invoked for each generation. Refer to the execution cycle. |

## `forEachGeneration(model, gen, gens, varargin)`
The actions for each generation.
### Arguments
| Argument | Description |
| - | - |
| `gen` | The current number of generations. It will be provided by the caller method. |
| `gens` | The total number of generations. It will be provided by the caller method. |
| `vargin` | A cell of arguments corresponding to the arguments (in order) provided to the `run` method. |
### Example
Here is an example that you can fill in to meet your own needs.

When calling the `run` method:

```matlab
myGAModel.run(myData, myOptions);
```

In the method:
```matlab
function forEachGeneration(model, gen, gens, varargin)
    % Retrieve arguments
    data = varargin{1};
    options = varargin{2};

    % Use a local vector instead of the fitnesses attribute to
    % avoid communication overhead (avoid broadcasting the 
    % entire model).
    fitnesses = zeros(model.populationSize, 1);
    
    % Replace parfor with for if parallel computing toolbox 
    % is not available
    parfor s=1:n
        fitnesses(s) = fitessEvaluationFunction(data, options);
    end
    
    % Sort the population according to individual's fitness 
    % score in descending order (required)
    fitnesses = model.sortPopulation(fitnesses);

    % Record the best and worst performing model's fitness
    % score (not required, but recommneded).
    model.statistics.minFitnesses(gen) = fitnesses(end);
    model.statistics.maxFitnesses(gen) = fitnesses(1);
    
    % Natural selection (required)
    model.naturalSelection();

    % Reproduction (required)
    model.reproduction(fitnesses);
end
```
